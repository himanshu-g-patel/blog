## Hello!

I'm Himanshu Patel, a Senior Engineering Leader based in San Francisco Bay Area, California. With over 18 years of experience in software engineering and leadership, I've had the privilege of building scalable platforms and leading high-performing teams at organizations like Workday and Wells Fargo.

## What I Do

Currently, I lead an engineering organization of 40+ engineers at Workday, where we build and maintain the Core Analytics and Reporting Engine—a multi-tenant cloud-native platform that processes over 5 billion queries monthly for 70 million users across 11,000 enterprise customers, including 60% of the Fortune 500.

My work focuses on:
- **Platform Engineering**: Building distributed systems that scale to billions of data rows
- **Product Development**: Taking products from 0→1, including semantic data layer for AI-ready enterprise data
- **Architecture**: Designing event-driven microservices and cloud-native solutions
- **Team Leadership**: Mentoring engineers and fostering engineering excellence

## My Journey

My career has spanned multiple domains—from digital payments at Wells Fargo (where I helped scale the Zelle platform with 162% YoY transaction growth) to analytics and reporting at Workday. Along the way, I've worked on everything from patent-winning eForm platform to cross-channel digital experiences that drove hundreds of millions in new assets.

I'm passionate about distributed systems, data infrastructure, and the intersection of engineering and product strategy. I believe in building systems that are not just technically sound but also deliver real business value.

## Technical Interests

I work extensively with:
- **Data Technologies**: Apache Calcite, Trino, DuckDB, Iceberg, Spark, Flink, Kafka
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Java, Scala, TypeScript, React, Spring
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Cloud-native architectures, microservices, CI/CD, chaos engineering
- **Emerging Tech**: Agentic workflows, semantic data layers, and AI-ready data platforms

## Beyond the Resume

I hold two US patents related to electronic forms and feature management. I earned my Master of Science in Applied Computer Science from East Tennessee State University and my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from the University of Pune, India.

## Why This Blog?

I started this blog to share insights from my journey—technical deep dives, leadership lessons, architectural decisions, and reflections on building software at scale. Whether you're an engineer, a technical leader, or just curious about distributed systems and platform engineering, I hope you'll find something valuable here.
